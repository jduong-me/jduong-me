I am a student with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems transitioning from the service industry to pursue a degree in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance.

## Objective

My love for gaming and technology has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
